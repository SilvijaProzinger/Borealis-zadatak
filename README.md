# Borealis-zadatak (a car service calculator)

This was a coding challenge for a job posting, the requirement was to create a car service calculator in React, which lets user select their car brand, the services they need and calculates their price, allows users to apply a coupon with 30%, enter their contact information and allows user to view and edit the selected options afterwards.

## How to run:
* clone or download
* cd to directory
* run npm start and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
